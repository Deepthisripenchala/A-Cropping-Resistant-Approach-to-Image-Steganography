# A-Cropping-Resistant-Approach-to-Image-Steganography
This project delves into various steganographic techniques, their implementations, and applications. Through an extensive literature review, we examine recent advancements in image steganography, including methods such as LSB insertion, randomization, hybrid techniques, and deep learning-based approaches. The project consists of several key modules: encoding, decoding, stego-key management, steganalysis(optional), and security countermeasures. Each module plays a crucial role in the process of hiding and retrieving hidden messages in images, ensuring both security and robustness against detection.

In the implementation section, we presented a Python-based approach for embedding and extracting messages in images using LSB insertion. This technique modifies the least significant bit of pixel values to embed binary data, balancing imperceptibility with data capacity.

Overall, this project aims to enhance the understanding and practical application of image steganography, emphasizing its significance in secure communication and identifying opportunities for further research and development.
